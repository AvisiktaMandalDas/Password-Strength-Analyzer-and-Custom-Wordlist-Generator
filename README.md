# Password-Strength-Analyzer-and-Custom-Wordlist-Generator
This project is a simple yet effective tool designed to help users and cybersecurity enthusiasts understand password security. It analyzes the strength of any given password using the zxcvbn library, which estimates how long it might take for an attacker to crack the password. Based on the score, the tool also provides useful suggestions to improve password strength, encouraging users to adopt safer password practices.

In addition to analysis, the tool generates a custom wordlist based on personal details, common password patterns, and leetspeak substitutions. This simulates how attackers might guess passwords by combining names, dates, pet names, and other predictable information. The generated wordlist can be used for educational purposes, penetration testing, and demonstrating how easily weak passwords can be cracked.

The project is implemented in Python and works entirely in the command line, making it lightweight and easy to use. It saves the generated wordlist into a .txt file, which can be imported into password-cracking tools for ethical testing. This makes it an excellent project for beginners in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and ethical hacking.

By combining password analysis and wordlist generation, this tool highlights the importance of choosing strong, unpredictable, and unique passwords.
